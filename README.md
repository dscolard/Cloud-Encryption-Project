# Cloud-Encryption-Project

Brief:

Design and implement a suitable desktop application capable of encrypting files and storing them securely in the cloud.
Any file subsequently downloaded from the cloud should be decrypted and stored in its original format.

Your application should also have a secure login screen so as only members of the 'secure cloud group' are able to access the application and its contents.
